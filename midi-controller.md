* Program a MIDI Controller
* Make a MIDI Controller: An Intro to Embedded Programming

Abstract
========

Embedded programming is cool, but a little scary to jump into. Arduino and Ruby lower this scare-factor considerably, but you still need an exciting project to get started. Follow me on my journey to build a custom MIDI controller for use in my guitar rig, and learn how to take a small hardware idea from conception to reality.

Details
=======

		*Include any pertinent details such as outlines, outcomes or intended audience.*

The intended audience for this talk are Ruby programmers who are interested in embedded programming, but are a little overwhelmed or not sure where to start. Any programmers who are also guitar gear junkies will also enjoy. :)

By the end of the talk, viewers should have a grasp of all the steps involved in prototyping a small Arduino project using ruby. Hopefully, they'll come away with ideas of their own.

Outline:

* Background:
	* What's MIDI?
	* What's Arduino?
* The Project
	* What are we building?
	* Controller Design
		* Feature 1: Preset Recall
		* Feature 2: Preset Learn
* Hardware Needed
	* Footswitches
	* Controller
	* MIDI Shield
* Software Needed
	* Libraries
	* Hello, Arduino/Ruby Example
	* Gotchas
* Show me the code!
	* Reading Data
	* Writing Data
	* Handling Footswitches
* Demo!
	* Preset: Recall
	* Preset: Learn

Pitch
=====

		*Explain why this talk should be considered and what makes you qualified to speak on the topic.*

A good last talk of the day, this one will be off-center and light. It also promotes a growing community of developers who are doing embedded work with ruby.

As a newbie to embedded programming, but not to ruby, I'll be speaking from a relatable perspective. My hope is to have people walk away without an excuse to not start a project of their own.
